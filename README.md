### overview
```
	A Hotel has many HotelRooms, but a HotelRoom can belong to only one Hotel.
	A HotelRoom can belong to only one Room but a Room can have many HotelRooms.
	A Room can have many RoomAmenities but RoomAmenities can only belong to one Room.
	Amenities can have many RoomAmenities but RoomAmenities can only have one Amenities.
```

### relationships
```
	A Hotel object contains the name, address, and phone number for each location. The HotelRoom table is
	a way of linking up Rooms to Hotels in the system. A Room is essentially a layout so each HotelRoom
	can only be based on one layout. These Room layouts also include the RoomAmenities which links
	the Room to the Amenities in the systen.
